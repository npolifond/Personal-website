      <p>As a third-year student at Georgia State University, technology has always been a consistent area in my life. When I collaborated with my high school's Girls Who Code App Development Competition, creating a school-based app, my interest in technology solidified, but my creativity started to take hold. <br>
         Being an active college student has allotted me the opportunities to grow my skills and face new challenges.<br>
     While actively participating in clubs such as girls who code and women in technology, I have exercised my technical, social, and … skills. With these skills, I have developed new projects and put my skills to the test, pushing myself further and further. As I continue to grow and learn, I am excited to expand my experiences to become the next contributor in the tech industry.
